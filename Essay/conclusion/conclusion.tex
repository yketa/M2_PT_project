In this essay, we have studied the orientational order of packings of anisotropic particles, here spheroids.\\

First, we have detailed the calculations of the recent paper by Nascimento \textit{et al.} \cite{nascimento2017density}, and determined the equilibrium nematic order parameter $S$ in static packings of hard-core spheroids. In accordance with the findings of \cite{nascimento2017density}, we have showed that such packings experience a first-order phase transition between a disordered, isotropic, phase and an orderered, anisotropic, phase. This transition occurs at a packing fraction which is a function of the aspect ratio of the spheroids. Futher inquieries are necessary to determine the possibility of coexistence between isotropic and nematic phases.\\

Then, after reminding that the jamming transition is a second-order phase transition, we have showed that sheared packings of soft-core spheroids display an orientational order at packing fractions lesser than the jamming density but that this order, measured with the nematic order parameter $S$, vanishes algebraically at jamming in accordance with the critical vanishing of the pressure. Further inquiries are necessary, first to find out what drives this transition from a nematic to an isotropic phase, and second to determine if the critical exponent associated to $S$ depends on the aspect ratio of the spheroids.
